# `data/03-features/`

This folder stores **feature artifacts** created from `data/02-preprocessed/`.

Depending on your stack, this may include feature matrices, embeddings, vectorized text, and any intermediate artifacts used for training/inference.

## What belongs here

- Feature tables (wide or long)
- Encoded representations (embeddings, tokenized text)
- Feature metadata (feature list, generation parameters)

## Conventions (recommended)

- Keep feature generation code in `src/pipelines/`.
- Store enough metadata to reproduce the exact feature set.
- Be explicit about time windows and leakage constraints.

## Example structure

```text
data/03-features/
  dataset_name/
    feature_set_a/
    feature_set_b/
```

## How This Fits

- Upstream: cleaned datasets in [`data/02-preprocessed/`](../02-preprocessed/)
- Downstream: training/inference and outputs in [`data/04-predictions/`](../04-predictions/)
- Generated by feature pipelines in [`src/pipelines/`](../../src/pipelines/)

## Project note

For the current Attack Type pipelines, baseline features (timestamp-derived and port buckets) are generated in-memory during training/inference and are not yet persisted to `data/03-features/`.
